Exam II Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are seven functions to be implemented and tested. The functions' 
declarations and descriptions can be found in src/list.h. The functions'
implementations should go in src/list.c. The unit tests should go in the
seven test source files in the tests directory.

Make sure to read the comments in src/list.h. The linked list you are 
implementing is a circular, doubly linked list.

Remember that you are graded on three aspects: functionality of the code you
write in src/list.c, the quality of your unit tests in the tests directory, and
your Makefile.

Feel free to add in your own main.c file in the src directory for quick testing.
The functions to be implemented should be quite short. Don't overthink things.

To submit, navigate up to the parent directory that contains this exam folder,
and zip up the whole folder with:

	zip -r <folder name>.zip <folder name>

Just like the practice exam. Before you submit, make sure you zipped up the
folder correctly by unzipping it IN ANOTHER DIRECTORY with:

	unzip <folder name>.zip

and verifying that the uncompressed folder is exactly the same as your exam
folder.

Submit your zip file on Brightspace.
